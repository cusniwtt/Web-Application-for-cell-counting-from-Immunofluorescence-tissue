The application utilizes advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to accurately identify and count the number of nuclei in DAPI-stained tissue biopsy images. The output of the application is presented in multiple formats including an image with identified nuclei highlighted, a numerical value indicating the total number of nuclei, and a table containing additional metrics such as the position and distribution of nuclei across the image. This Web Application would be beneficial for researchers and medical professionals working in pathology, oncology, and cell biology, as it would save time and increase the accuracy of their analyses. </h5>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
